# 0x04. Loops, Conditions and ParsingHello there!
This is a collection of bash scripts designed to perform specific tasks. Here's a brief overview of what each script does:
- `1-for_best_school`: This script uses a for loop to print "Best School" 10 times.
- `2-while_best_school`: This script uses a while loop to print "Best School" 10 times.
- `3-until_best_school`: This script uses an until loop to print "Best School" 10 times.
- `4-if_9_say_hi`: This script uses a combination of while loop and if statement to print "Best School" 10 times, but prints "Hi" on the 9th iteration.
- `5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance`: This script uses a combination of for loop and if statements to print numbers 1 to 10, replacing 4 with "bad luck" and 8 with "good luck".
- `6-superstitious_numbers`: This script uses a combination of for loop and if statements to print numbers 1 to 20, replacing 4, 8, and 17 with "bad luck from China", "bad luck from Japan", and "bad luck from Italy" respectively.
- `7-clock`: This script uses nested for loops to print minutes and "Hour: <hour>" when minutes are a multiple of 60 (i.e., hours). It prints from 0 to 12hrs59mins.
- `8-for_ls`: This script uses a for loop and string manipulation commands to remove the preceding number and dash from filenames and prints the result. For example, 121-filename becomes filename.
- `9-to_file_or_not_to_file`: This script uses file test operators to provide information about a file, such as whether it exists, is empty, or is a regular file.
- `10-fizzbuzz`: Ah, the classic FizzBuzz! This script uses a combination of for loop and if statements to print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".
