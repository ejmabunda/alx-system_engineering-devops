# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Introduction
This project explores the concepts of processes and signals in the Linux environment. The following scripts showcase various aspects of managing processes and handling signals.

## Scripts

1. **0-what-is-my-pid**: This script displays its own PID.

2. **1-list_your_processes**: This script displays a list of currently running processes.

3. **2-show_your_bash_pid**: This script displays a list of currently running bash processes.

4. **3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy**: Displays the PID and process name of bash processes.

5. **4-to_infinity_and_beyond**: Displays 'To infinity and beyond' indefinitely.

6. **5-dont_stop_me_now**: This script stops '4-to_infinity_and_beyond'.

7. **6-stop_me_if_you_can**: This script stops '4-to_infinity_and_beyond' without using kill or killall.

8. **67-stop_me_if_you_can**: This script also stops '4-to_infinity_and_beyond' without using kill or killall.

9. **7-highlander**: This script displays 'To infinity and beyond' indefinitely.

10. **8-beheaded_process**: This script stops '7-highlander'.

## Conclusion
These scripts provide a hands-on exploration of process management and signal handling in a Linux environment. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective system administration and programming on Unix-like systems.
